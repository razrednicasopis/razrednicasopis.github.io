<p><center><h1>TRUTH AND LIES</h1></center>
<center><br>
Painfull truth and pretty lies,</center>

<center>what'll happen when our love dies?<p>
Is it true that you're still mine, <p>
even though we're not always doing fine?<p>
Is it lie that you didn't like me just for my look,<p>
or is it just my fantasy from a book?</center><br>
 
<center>Why are you always in my mind when I'm overthinking? <p>
And why do I always look at you without even blinking? <p>
What is the truth and what is a lie, <p>
I guess I'll never know <p>
till the day we say each other goodbye. </center><br>
